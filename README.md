# IoT Data Analytics with Protocol Buffers, Google Cloud Functions, and MongoDB Atlas
Project files for demonstration detailed in the article, [IoT Telemetry Collection using Google Protocol Buffers, Cloud Functions, Cloud Pub/Sub, and MongoDB Atlas](https://wp.me/p1RD28-6l6)

Collect IoT sensor telemetry using Google Protocol Buffers’ serialized binary format over HTTPS, serverless Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Pub/Sub, and MongoDB Atlas on GCP, as an alternative to integrated Cloud IoT platforms and standard IoT protocols. Aggregate, analyze, and build machine learning models with the data using tools such as MongoDB Compass, Jupyter Notebooks, and Google’s AI Platform Notebooks.
